# Optimize SSL by caching session parameters for 10 minutes. This cuts down on the number of expensive SSL handshakes.
# The handshake is the most CPU-intensive operation, and by default it is re-negotiated on every new/parallel connection.
# By enabling a cache (of type "shared between all Nginx workers"), we tell the client to re-use the already negotiated state.
# Further optimization can be achieved by raising keepalive_timeout, but that shouldn't be done unless you serve primarily HTTPS.
